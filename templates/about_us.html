        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We are a team of emerging AI engineers with a shared passion for building transformative solutions that address real-world challenges. Our work brings together diverse skill sets in artificial intelligence, data science, computer vision, and full-stack development. This collaborative spirit has culminated in the creation of our capstone project—Deep Learning Based 3D Visualization of Blood Cells using Microscopic Imaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this project, we set out to revolutionize traditional medical diagnostics and education by integrating powerful deep learning models with interactive 3D visualization. Our goal is to create meaningful, user-centric technologies that empower healthcare professionals, researchers, and learners. Each team member has contributed to different aspects of this system—from model architecture and data engineering to 3D rendering and web deployment—making this a truly end-to-end AI solution.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to harness the power of deep learning and immersive technologies to improve biomedical image interpretation and learning. We are committed to building accessible, scalable, and intelligent platforms that assist clinicians in making faster and more accurate diagnoses while also providing educators and students with intuitive learning tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to close the gap between computational intelligence and human understanding by creating solutions that are not only technically sound but also practically useful in clinical, academic, and research environments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a future where artificial intelligence seamlessly integrates with healthcare workflows, enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. By combining AI-driven precision with interactive 3D visualization, we aspire to redefine how medical professionals and students engage with diagnostic data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our long-term vision is to evolve this platform into a powerful tool for early disease detection, personalized medicine, and immersive medical education. We believe in continuous innovation and strive to be at the forefront of AI in healthcare—building solutions that are ethical, impactful, and globally accessible.
        </p>
